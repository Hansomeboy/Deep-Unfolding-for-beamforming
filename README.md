# Deep-Unfolding-For-Beamforming
This repository contains two scripts of code used to generate the results in research dealing with learn to rapidly and robustly optimize the beamforming problem in a hybrid architecture, as discussed in the paper attached to this repository.
The results can be obtained in more or less 6 hours. For convinence, the PDF version of each python-notebook is attached.
