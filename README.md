# Deep-Unfolding-For-Beamforming
This repository contains two scripts of code used to generate the results in research dealing with learn to rapidly and robustly optimize the beamforming problem in a hybrid architecture, as discussed in the paper attached to this repository.
The first scenario uses a synthetic data denerated by python, and invovles i.i.d. entries to the channel matrix, denoted as H.
On the contrary, scenario 2 deal with a Quadriga-generated data, a commonly used data-genratoe in the field of communications and signal processing. 
The results can be obtained in more or less 6 hours. For convinence, the PDF version of each python-notebook is attached.
